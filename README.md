# Minecraft Server Discord Bot
A discord bot meant to, start, stop, give the status of, a minecraft server. This bot is capable of running multiple in game commands like changing weather, time, and running server wide announcements.

Steps to create the bot:

1. Input your bot token that you can get from here https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me. Look up making a discord bot if you dont know what this is. 

2. Put the bot token in your settings page of the application, along with server jarfile, and the path of the jarfile, as well as the max and min ram for the server to use.

3. Hit save, and close the settings form, then hit the lauch bot option.

4. Wait for the bot to start, then type ;;start in your discord server, to start the minecraft server, then wait about the time it takes to start, run the ;;status command for info on your server.

5. Have fun!
